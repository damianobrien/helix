<h1>Helix PHP Framework Documentation</h1><p>	These pages contain the documentation for the Helix PHP Framework.</p><h2>What is Helix?</h2><p>	Helix is a software development framework that enables you to build web applications in a very intuitive way, so that you can easily make changes or enhancements in the future.  The framework can be used to run multiple advanced applications on the same server, or a single web site.</p><h2>Is this just another MVC framework?</h2><p>	No.  Helix is not an MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework.  It is a very intuitive way of thinking about web applications, from the design of the pages to handling of user events.  Helix takes some of the best ideas from other development frameworks and combines them into a new approach to building web applications.</p><p>	For example, you won't see any controllers or views, but instead there are layouts, pages and blocks.  You won't see any automatic postbacks or black-box server controls, but there are (optionally) codebehind classes for all of the pages.  You will definitely notice the SoC (Separation of Concerns) supported by the framework, so that there is no business logic mixed in with the presentation layers.   </p>
